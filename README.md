# QB_Hackathon


## What's up
- some data analysis of the data source ( 1/4 in India, rest all around the world)
- Balanced dataset (almost 50/50 of plume, no_plume data)
- First model results quite promising (need to compare to other group, but at least the streamlit team can start working with the first model trained that is on the git repo) : 80% accu, AUC_score above 0.9

## Ideas improvement:
- do an **weighted ensemble method** using deep results and classical ML with geography (country, prior knowledge on leak existing proba, wind speed, ecological reports)
- data augmentation
- runn for a longer period of time
- data augmentation
- one model per country/wind speed average slices/temperature/methane companies ?

#### classical ML
